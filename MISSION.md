## Mission & Scope
- Maintain parity between backend simulation services, the React/Vite client, and supporting docs.
- This document governs every directory in the repo; add nested AGENTS.md files for narrower overrides.
- Favor incremental, reviewable changes; avoid sweeping refactors without prior discussion.
- Default to reproducibility: include exact commands, seeds, and script names in PR descriptions.
