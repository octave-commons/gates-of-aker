Oh that gives me a great idea for a game mechanic. I was thinkng aboout how we hand the champions life cycles... Then you said \*prestige\*, and I was reminded of the common prestige game mechanic. You restart your character, but you get to start with extra advantages using a special prestige currency afterwards.  So champions can retire, and your diety chooses a new champion from among the young and loyal

Champion “Prestige” as a myth-engine mechanic
---------------------------------------------

This fits _perfectly_ with your world model: a champion’s life doesn’t just end — it **solidifies into culture**. When they retire, their deeds become _prestige_ that reshapes what the next generation can do.

### Core loop

1.  **Champion lives a full arc** (quests, conflicts, diplomacy, miracles, scandals).

2.  **Retirement / ascension / martyrdom** triggers a “closing rite” (your **Aker** moment — a threshold event).

3.  The champion’s impact is **distilled into a prestige currency**.

4.  The deity **selects a new champion** from young/loyal aspirants.

5.  Player spends prestige to **seed advantages** (not raw power—_social leverage_, _institutions_, _mythic permission_).

6.  New champion inherits a world that is _different because the last one existed_.


* * *

What the prestige currency _is_ (keep it culture-agnostic)
----------------------------------------------------------

Use a name that feels mythic but not tied to one pantheon:

*   **Legacy**

*   **Renown**

*   **Oathfire**

*   **Mythseed**

*   **Glory**

*   **Echo**


Mechanically, it’s “how much the world believes the story you’ve written.”

### How it’s earned (important: make it about _social effects_)

Award it for things that change the _graph_:

*   founding or reforming institutions

*   creating alliances / peace terms / vassalage

*   converting or reconciling factions

*   establishing trade routes / messenger networks

*   surviving scandals (or weaponizing them)

*   creating a “myth node” (a story that persists and spreads)


* * *

The new champion selection (this is where it gets juicy)
--------------------------------------------------------

When a champion retires, generate a **candidate pool** based on the current social world state:

**Candidate eligibility**

*   youth + loyalty (as you said)

*   plus _faction ties_, _skills_, _temperament_, _taboos_, _secret affiliations_


**Candidate “shape” is produced by the world**

*   If your last champion built temples: more _devout_ candidates.

*   If they built trade networks: more _merchant-adjacent_ candidates.

*   If they ruled through fear: more _hardliner / opportunist_ candidates.

*   If they elevated scholars: more _scribe / diplomat_ candidates.


So the player isn’t picking from a random menu — they’re picking from **the culture they created**.

* * *

What prestige buys (avoid snowball, keep it story-driven)
---------------------------------------------------------

Think “starting leverage,” not “+20 damage.”

### 1) Social permission

*   **Right of Audience** (meet rulers / councils sooner)

*   **Sanctioned Voice** (rumors trend in your favor)

*   **Oathbinding** (contracts are easier to enforce)


### 2) Institutional inheritance

*   A small **retinue**

*   A **patron network**

*   A **safehouse / shrine / embassy**

*   A **messenger route** node


### 3) Mythic artifacts (rare, limited slots)

*   A single relic, title, or sigil that gives narrative authority

*   Costs _a lot_ of prestige, has upkeep or risk


### 4) Bloodline / mentorship

*   The retired champion can create an **apprentice line**

*   Next champion might start with a **mentor**, but also inherited baggage


* * *

Retirement triggers (Aker moments)
----------------------------------

Make retirement happen when the _world rhythm_ demands it:

*   **Age / injury / exhaustion**

*   **Political saturation** (too famous to move unseen)

*   **Aker threshold events**: solstice-equivalents, regime change, civil war end, prophecy fulfilled

*   **Voluntary abdication** for a big prestige payout (tempting choice)


You can even let the deity _push_ retirement early as a strategic sacrifice.

* * *

Balancing: keep it meaningful without becoming “infinite power”
---------------------------------------------------------------

A couple of simple rules:

*   Prestige advantages are **narrow** (situational leverage, not universal buffs).

*   Prestige decays into “tradition” if hoarded (use it or it fossilizes into NPC culture).

*   New champion always inherits **new problems** (factions adapt; rivals learn your patterns).


* * *

Why this fits your “prestige culture” theme
-------------------------------------------

You’re literally simulating how a “prestige civilization” forms:

*   **stories become norms**

*   **norms become institutions**

*   **institutions produce the next generation**


Your prestige mechanic becomes the player-facing handle for that.

* * *

If you want the next step, I can write:

*   a small **data model** for “retirement distillation” (what graph deltas convert into prestige)

*   10–15 **prestige perks** that map cleanly to Hermes/Sun/Moon roles _without naming them as gods_ (so it stays mythology-portable)
