This is a really good mythic backbone
-------------------------------------

What you’re describing already has a _native_ anchor point in real myth-history:

*   **Hermopolis** literally becomes “the City of Hermes” in Greek because the Greeks identified **Hermes with Thoth**, and the city is a major cult center of Thoth. [Wikipedia+2Encyclopedia Britannica+2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermopolis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*   Its older Egyptian name **Khmunu / Khemenu** means “**City of the Eight**,” pointing at the **Ogdoad** creation-myth cluster that’s centered there. [Wikipedia+2Encyclopedia Britannica+2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermopolis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*   It’s described as a provincial capital **since the Old Kingdom**. [Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermopolis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


So “Hermopolis” isn’t just a cool-sounding city—it’s basically a pre-built symbol for **syncretism + scribal reality + ideas becoming infrastructure**.

Day/night as _a system primitive_ (very Egypt-coded)
----------------------------------------------------

Two pieces of Egyptian myth slot cleanly into your “communication + day/night” engine:

*   **Ra’s daily + nightly journey**: by day across the sky, by night through the Duat, returning at dawn—time as a repeating loop, with the horizon as a gate. [Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*   **Aker’s twin lions** guarding the horizons—named **“yesterday” and “tomorrow”**—which is an incredibly game-y symbol for the day/night handoff and “state flips.” [Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aker_%28deity%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


And if you want the _three-phase_ daily swap baked in:

*   **Khepri (morning), Ra (midday), Atum (evening)** as aspects of the solar cycle. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khepri?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


That gives you a mythic justification for why the sim’s social rules feel different by phase.

A naming move that keeps it distinct but connected
--------------------------------------------------

If you’re centering a default mini-pantheon of **Hermes/Thoth + Apollo + Artemis**, I’d treat the engine name as the _place where those forces collide_, not the gods themselves.

### Best “this is the myth engine” names

*   **Hermopolis**
    The city where _messages become reality_. It also naturally carries the Thoth/Hermes blending you want. [Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermopolis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*   **Khmunu**
    Same place, _older, stranger, more yours_. Also quietly encodes “many forces at once” via the “Eight” framing. [Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermopolis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*   **Aker Gate** (or **The Aker**)
    If day/night transition is sacred in the design, naming the _threshold_ is powerful. [Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aker_%28deity%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


How the three gods map cleanly onto your social-sim graph
---------------------------------------------------------

*   **Hermes/Thoth** = _propagation layer_
    Rumors, trade, memetics, messages, record-keeping, “who knows what,” and how fast it spreads.

*   **Apollo** = _day/public order layer_
    Institutions, legitimacy, law, ceremonies, official narratives, visible status.

*   **Artemis** = _night/private layer_
    Secrets, liminal ties, shadow markets, taboo, cults, hidden alliances.


Then **Aker** is your **mode-switch**: what rules “win” at the boundary.
