## AGENTS.md Breakdown and Documentation Enhancement

### Summary
Analyzed and enhanced the AGENTS.md file to provide clearer instructions for future agents, ensuring all wiki links resolve to actual documents and capturing missing documentation.

### Actions Completed

1. **Link Analysis**: Verified all wiki links in AGENTS.md and identified missing documents
2. **Document Creation**: Created missing documents:
   - `ORPHANED-FILES.md` - Generated files and cleanup procedures
   - `ROADMAP.md` - Current milestones and priorities
3. **Documentation Enhancement**: Restructured AGENTS.md with:
   - Clear warning banner for agents to read linked documents first
   - Logical grouping of documentation sections
   - Explicit file path mappings for wiki links
   - Hierarchical organization (Core docs, Development workflow, Technical architecture, etc.)

### Key Improvements

- **Clear Instructions**: Added prominent warning for agents to always read linked documents before implementing features
- **Complete Link Coverage**: All wiki links now resolve to actual documents
- **Logical Organization**: Grouped related documentation for better navigation
- **Future-Proof Structure**: Established pattern for subdirectory AGENTS.md files to reference this main file

### Documents Verified
All linked documents exist and are accessible:
- Core specs (core-loop, myth-engine, labeling-system)
- Backend and frontend style guides  
- Development workflow documentation
- Planning and roadmap documents

The AGENTS.md file now serves as a comprehensive navigation hub with clear instructions for future agents working on this codebase.
