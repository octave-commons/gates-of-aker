The cleanest “third pillar” names
---------------------------------

### **Agora**

_Public square + marketplace of ideas._
Fits a text-native knowledge graph where rumors, norms, status, and institutions collide.

*   Promethean = tools

*   Pantheon = gods/institutions

*   **Agora = people/social dynamics**


### **Chorus**

_Collective voice that narrates the world._
Great if you want “emergent myth” to feel like it’s being sung into existence by many agents.

### **Egregore**

_A collective thoughtform that becomes “real” through shared belief._
Very on-theme for social phenomenon, memetics, institutional reality, and myth crystallization.

### **Noosphere**

_Sphere of shared mind/culture._
If you want the “study/simulation” angle to read more academic and less fantasy.

### **Polis**

_City-state as a unit of social order._
Good if your simulation focuses on governance, legitimacy, class, factions, civic religion.

Names that explicitly signal “myth engine”
------------------------------------------

These are more literal (good for clarity, slightly less mythic-mysterious):

*   **MythForge**

*   **LoreFoundry**

*   **MythLoom**

*   **FableEngine**

*   **CanonWeaver**

*   **ChronicleWorks**


Names that lean “graph / language / social science”
---------------------------------------------------

If you want the “study social phenomenon” identity to be obvious:

*   **Sociograph**

*   **Mythograph**

*   **Narrative Graph**

*   **Civitas**

*   **Forum**

*   **Consensus Engine**

*   **Causality Loom**


My top 5 for _your_ stated vibe
-------------------------------

1.  **Agora** (best balance: mythic + social + readable)

2.  **Egregore** (best “belief becomes real” framing)

3.  **Chorus** (best “emergent narrative voice” framing)

4.  **Noosphere** (best “simulation/study” framing)

5.  **MythLoom** (best “engine that weaves myth” without being too academic)


A naming scheme that keeps things cohesive
------------------------------------------

If you like a consistent ecosystem feel:

*   **Promethean** — platform/toolchain

*   **Pantheon** — ideology/gods/institutions layer (UI fits here nicely)

*   **Agora** (or **Chorus/Egregore**) — social myth simulation engine

*   Then internal modules can be clean and legible:

    *   `agora-core`, `agora-sim`, `agora-graph`, `agora-text`, `agora-ui`

    *   or `egregore-core`, `egregore-events`, `egregore-society`

## ChatGPT
Blending **Polis** with Hermes / Apollo / Artemis
-------------------------------------------------

**Polis** reads as _civic order, institutions, law, class, factional gravity_.
Adding a god-name can “tilt” the vibe toward what your engine _actually does_.

*   **Hermes** → communication, trade, travel, rumors, boundary-crossing, messengers

*   **Apollo** → daylight, order, prophecy, rational structure, civic clarity

*   **Artemis** → night, wilderness, secrets, liminal spaces, hidden networks


### Hermes-flared options (communication-first)

These keep _Polis_ but imply “the city is made of messages”:

*   **Hermopolis**
    Strong and obvious. Also a real historical place-name, so it’s searchable-noisy but mythically legit.

*   **Keryxpolis** _(kḗryx = herald)_
    “Herald-city” — very on-theme for a rumor/announcement/dispatch-driven sim.

*   **Caduceapolis** _(caduceus = Hermes’ staff)_
    A little extra, but memorable, and screams “messenger networks.”

*   **Mercurypolis** _(Latin Hermes)_
    More Roman flavor; very readable.


If you want _less_ “proper noun god name” and more “system name”:

*   **Signalpolis**

*   **Rumorpolis**

*   **Dispatch Polis**

*   **Courier Polis**


### Apollo / Artemis flared options (day/night as a _core mechanic_)

If the simulation’s _rhythm_ matters (day institutions vs night subcultures):

*   **Apollopolis**
    Feels like “orderly civic simulation.” (Also resembles some ancient place names.)

*   **Artemispolis**
    Feels like “the city at night,” clandestine ties, hunts, hidden factions.

*   **Luminopolis** / **Noctipolis**
    Clear day/night split without invoking specific deities.


### A spicy “day-night cycle” word that’s secretly perfect

*   **Nycthemeron** _(night+day = a full 24h cycle)_
    This one is _chef’s kiss_ if your engine cares about social behavior across the cycle.
    It’s distinct, scholarly, and myth-adjacent without being Disney-adjacent.


You can still keep the pantheon flavor via subsystems:

*   `nycthemeron-apollo` (day layer: courts, markets, rituals, legitimacy)

*   `nycthemeron-artemis` (night layer: crime, secrets, cults, backchannels)

*   `nycthemeron-hermes` (messaging layer: rumors, trade routes, courier nets)


My top picks based on what you said
-----------------------------------

1.  **Keryxpolis** — Polis + “communication is reality”

2.  **Nycthemeron** — the day/night engine name that feels _distinct_ but aligned

3.  **Hermopolis** — bold, mythic, immediate (with real-world name collision)


If you tell me whether you want the name to feel more **mythic** or more **systems/academic**, I’ll lock a final 3 and propose matching module names that rhyme with **Promethean** + **Pantheon**.
