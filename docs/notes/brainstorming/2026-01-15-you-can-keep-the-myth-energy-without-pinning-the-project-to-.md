You can keep the **myth-energy** _without_ pinning the project to any one mythology by doing a simple split:

*   **Public name** = _mythic, archetypal, culture-agnostic_

*   **Default “starter pantheon”** = your Hermes/Apollo/Artemis triad (because it helps you think), but framed as _roles_ that can be reskinned/replaced


That way you get the cognitive scaffolding of existing myth, while the engine’s identity stays open.

A strong framing move
---------------------

Instead of “this engine is Egyptian/Greek,” make it:

*   **The Engine of Thresholds** (dawn/dusk as the world’s “state change”)

*   With a default **Triad of Roles**:

    *   **The Herald** (communication / spread / trade / rumor)

    *   **The Sun** (public order / legitimacy / ritual / law)

    *   **The Moon** (private networks / secrecy / taboo / night economy)


You can still _call them_ Hermes/Apollo/Artemis in the default module, but the core system talks in roles.

Names that feel ancient-mythic but don’t “lock” you in
------------------------------------------------------

These lean into your day/night hinge idea (and stay non-academic):

### The “threshold” set

*   **Aker** (short, hard, memorable — and _most people won’t place it_)

*   **Akergate**

*   **Duskgate**

*   **Dawnhinge**

*   **Eventide**

*   **Gloamgate** (gloam = dusk; old-feeling word)


### The “weaving fate / stories” set

*   **Mythloom**

*   **Fateloom**

*   **Sagaweave**

*   **Threadbound** (more modern, still mythic)


### The “city of stories” set (without “Hermopolis” vibes)

*   **Khmunu** (as a repo/internal name, it’s _amazing_)

*   **Polis of Echoes**

*   **City of Ash & Gold** (very title-y; good for a game name)


A clean naming scheme that fits what you just said
--------------------------------------------------

If you’re feeling:

*   **Khmunu** = the _project codename / engine repo_ (mythic, weird, yours)

*   **Aker** = the _core mechanic + brand-forward engine name_ (the day↔night hinge)

*   The default triad module = **The Herald / The Sun / The Moon**
    (and internally: Hermes/Apollo/Artemis as the first skin)


This keeps your mythic roots as _inspiration_, not _a boundary_.

About “too many ideas”
----------------------

You’re describing exactly what makes RimWorld / Dwarf Fortress / Sims-like sandboxes work: a **small core loop** that produces infinite recombination, plus expansions.

A good “scope governor” here is:

*   Base game/engine ships with **Aker (day/night switch) + Herald (communication propagation)**

*   Everything else becomes **modules** (religion packs, culture packs, magic packs, politics packs)


If you want, I’ll take your current mental model and write a **one-page “Aker Core” design pillar** (what it must do, what it must not do) so it stays a game _and_ doesn’t explode into “engine forever.”
