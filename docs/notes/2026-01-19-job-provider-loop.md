# 2026-01-19 Job Providers + Recipe Loop

- Job creation now stems from structure providers (workshop, improvement hall, harvesters, quarry, smelter).
- Provider caps limit pending job counts; initial world seeds 16 provider jobs.
- Rocky biome spawns ore variants (iron, copper, tin, gold, silver, aluminum, lead).
- New jobs: builder, improve, mine, smelt; smelting consumes ore items into ingots.
