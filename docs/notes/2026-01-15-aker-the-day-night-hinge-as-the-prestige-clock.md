Aker: the day/night hinge as the _prestige clock_
-------------------------------------------------

You wanted Aker as the transition—so make it the timing system:

*   The world has **phases** (Day / Night)

*   Certain actions are only safe/effective in one phase

*   Retirement is easiest at **phase boundaries** (dawn/dusk events)


### The “Aker Rite”

When a champion retires, run an Aker rite that:

*   freezes rumor propagation briefly (everyone watches)

*   evaluates the era (distillation)

*   releases the successor (new champion appears with omen)


In UI terms: a transition screen where you spend prestige + pick successor + accept baggage.

* * *

A compact “one page” ruleset you can build from
-----------------------------------------------

### State tracked per era

*   `prestige.herald`, `prestige.solar`, `prestige.lunar`

*   `inheritance[]` (institution nodes, route nodes, allies, titles)

*   `baggage[]` (feuds, debts, curses, scandals, prophecies)


### Retirement event outputs

*   Token bundle (3 types)

*   1–3 inheritances

*   1–3 baggage items

*   Candidate list (with Calling/Shadow/Bond/Taboo)


### Start-of-era spend

*   Spend tokens on boons/world edits

*   Choose champion

*   Choose one “era doctrine” (optional): a policy that biases simulation


* * *

Next: want this to feel RimWorld-y?
-----------------------------------

RimWorld works because it has:

*   strong _storyteller constraints_

*   meaningful random pressure

*   persistent consequences


So we can add an **Aker Storyteller** that:

*   chooses conflict pacing based on how stable the graph is

*   intentionally injects stress when the story stagnates

*   favors different kinds of crises in Day vs Night


If you want, I’ll write:

1.  **10 baggage archetypes** (that produce drama but don’t softlock)

2.  **10 inheritance archetypes** (that feel like “civilization advancement”)

3.  An **Aker Storyteller** rule set (how it decides when to stir chaos)
