# 2026-01-20 Roads, Happiness, Rest, Stat Sheets

- Added road structures that pathfinding prefers and movement treats as speedways.
- Social interactions now add happier thought lines and stronger mood uplift on positive bonds.
- Rest decays while awake, recovers while sleeping (bonus near houses), and sleep restores rest.
- UI stat sheets now list movement step counts for normal vs. road travel.
