# Notes — 2026-01-15 — World Size Controls

## Summary
- `sim/reset` (WebSocket + HTTP) accepts an optional `size` payload `[width height]` in addition to `seed`.
- Backend clamps both dimensions to the inclusive range 6-60, defaults to `20x20`, and threads the resolved size through world state + snapshots.
- Reset snapshots broadcast via `:state` and every tick snapshot now include a `size` field consumed by the React client.
- The debugger UI exposes width/height number inputs that ride along with `Reset world`, updating the canvas grid and click math automatically.

## Usage
- Example REST call: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sim/reset -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"seed": 2, "size": [30, 18]}'`.
- WebSocket reset payload mirrors the shape: `{ "op": "reset", "seed": 2, "size": [30, 18] }`.
- Canvas highlights and shrine placement now respect the live `snapshot.size`, so operators can immediately verify different aspect ratios.
