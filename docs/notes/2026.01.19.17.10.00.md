## World bootstrapping

- 2026-01-19: Initial worlds now cluster agents and houses around the campfire, pre-place lumberyard/orchard/granary/quarry, and expose a day/night daylight value for canvas shading.
- 2026-01-19: Dead agents now stop moving or taking jobs, and the UI shows cause of death from status.
- 2026-01-19: Slowed food decay, increased starting fruit supply, and boosted harvest yields to reduce starvation pressure.
- 2026-01-19: Biomes now use simplex noise with a mild center bias for fields, so food-rich regions can spawn closer to the village.
- 2026-01-19: Grid stroke width now scales inversely with zoom to avoid flicker when scrolling.
- 2026-01-19: Day/night overlay now renders in screen space so it follows the camera instead of sticking to origin.
- 2026-01-19: Mouse wheel zoom now uses functional camera updates to prevent alternating zoom glitches.
- 2026-01-19: Zoom now scales multiplicatively and locks the mouse position in world space, preventing snaps to origin.
- 2026-01-19: Wheel zoom handler now attaches once to avoid alternating stale camera state.
- 2026-01-19: Canvas now accounts for devicePixelRatio to stabilize grid rendering during zoom.
- 2026-01-19: Camera transform now uses a DPR reset + translate/scale to stabilize zoom centering after panning.
- 2026-01-19: Mouse wheel zoom step increased for faster zooming.
- 2026-01-19: Sleep now slows hunger decay, nightfall encourages sleep jobs, and the UI shows time/season/year with temperature and daylight.
- 2026-01-19: Agent deaths now trigger a low, sustained alert tone in the UI.
- 2026-01-19: Audio starts muted by default; clicking play or the speaker icon now unlocks audio and plays tones.
- 2026-01-19: Clicking an agent card now snaps the camera to that agent's position.
- 2026-01-19: On load/reset, the camera snaps to the shrine if present, otherwise the campfire town center is selected and centered.
- 2026-01-19: The initial world now places a shrine at the campfire, and the job queue splits assigned/unassigned with richer metadata.
- 2026-01-19: Default start now spawns 16 agents and runs at ~15 FPS (66ms ticks).
- 2026-01-19: Movement and path debug now use A* pathing instead of BFS.
