Retirement distillation: turning “a life” into Prestige
-------------------------------------------------------

Think of retirement as a **compression pass** over the knowledge graph:

*   Inputs: what changed during the champion’s era

*   Output: a small bundle of **Prestige tokens** + **World inheritance** + **Baggage**


### What gets measured

Instead of XP-ish numbers, score _structural changes_:

*   **Bonds created** (alliances, marriages, sworn oaths)

*   **Conflicts resolved** (peace treaties, feuds ended—or redirected)

*   **Institutions founded** (orders, courts, guilds, shrines, schools)

*   **Routes opened** (trade, messenger, pilgrimage, smuggling)

*   **Narratives stabilized** (rumors disproven, myths canonized)

*   **Taboos invoked** (holy laws, bans, scandals)

*   **Violence footprint** (wars won/lost; atrocities; martyrdom)


### Distillation formula (simple, mythic, readable)

Use three token types that match your triad _as roles_:

*   **Herald Marks** → communication / networks / rumor control

*   **Solar Seals** → legitimacy / law / public institutions

*   **Lunar Knots** → secrecy / underworld ties / hidden leverage


They’re just archetypes—skins can map them to any mythology later.

> Prestige = a _bundle_ across these, not one currency.
> That avoids “one optimal build” and makes the world feel multi-dimensional.

What the deity actually “buys” with Prestige
--------------------------------------------

### 1) Seed advantages (start-of-life boons)

These should feel like **permissions**, not raw stats.

**Herald boons**

*   _Courier’s Favor_: faster message latency along 1–2 routes

*   _Public Whisper_: start with a small rumor already trending

*   _Open Ears_: informants appear earlier; secrets surface faster


**Solar boons**

*   _Writ of Standing_: access to councils / courts without proving yourself

*   _Sanctioned Rite_: you can safely perform a miracle type once per cycle

*   _Civic Backing_: a small institution owes you first assistance


**Lunar boons**

*   _Safehouse Thread_: one guaranteed hiding place in each major region

*   _Mask of Silence_: one scandal can be buried per arc (but it costs)

*   _Night Covenant_: a shadow faction starts neutral/friendly


### 2) World edits (bigger, rarer, more permanent)

The fun stuff: spend prestige to _rewrite the map_ a little.

*   Establish a **guild charter**

*   Found a **monastic/scholarly order**

*   Declare a **holy day / festival** that changes day/night behavior

*   Create a **border law** that changes faction movement rules

*   Set up a **messenger relay** (big Hermes energy, but skin-agnostic)


### 3) Inheritance + baggage (always both)

Every era leaves behind:

*   **Inheritance** (a title, ally, institution, route, relic)

*   **Baggage** (a feud, debt, prophecy, scandal, rival school of thought)


Baggage is crucial: it keeps prestige from being “pure upside.”

New champion selection: make it emergent and “earned”
-----------------------------------------------------

### Candidate pool generation

At retirement, generate 5–12 candidates from _real social roots_:

*   **Youth**: from families/orders tied to the deity’s current influence

*   **Loyalty**: measured via past events (who showed up, who paid cost)

*   **Proximity**: candidates who live near your institutions/routes

*   **Narrative resonance**: candidates whose “story tags” match the era


### Give each candidate a mythic hook

Each candidate gets:

*   **Calling** (why them)

*   **Shadow** (what follows them)

*   **Bond** (who they’re tied to)

*   **Taboo** (what they must not do)


Example:

*   Calling: “Raised in the courier-temple”

*   Shadow: “Accused of carrying forbidden letters”

*   Bond: “Owes their life to the retired champion”

*   Taboo: “Cannot spill blood at dawn”


This turns selection into story, not optimization.
