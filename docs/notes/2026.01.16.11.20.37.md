## TODO

- [x] Document Docker compose setup when ready.
- [x] Capture Compose launch verification steps once containers start cleanly.

## Docker Compose verification
- 2026-01-16 11:45 UTC: Added `compose.yaml` with `backend` (clojure:temurin-17-tools-deps) and `web` (node:20-bullseye) services. Both mount repo + caches; frontend service wires `VITE_BACKEND_ORIGIN` for container-to-container WS/HTTP.
- 2026-01-16 13:05 UTC: Added `web/e2e/compose.e2e.mjs` WebSocket + frontend availability check, `npm run compose:up/down`, and `npm run test:e2e`. Test waits on `/healthz`, issues a `tick`, and polls `http://localhost:5173` to ensure Vite dev server is reachable.
- To verify: run `npm run test:e2e` (requires Docker). Command brings up Compose, executes the e2e script, and tears down the stack. Review logs for WebSocket "hello"/"tick" events and ensure the script exits 0.
