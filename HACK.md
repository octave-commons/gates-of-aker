# description

If rimworld, factorio, and oxygen not included were all combined in a top down 2.5d action adventure colony builder
The world is a sphere of hexagonal tiles
tiles are each map instances
there are different layers of view as you zoom out
unlike in rimworld, you could zoom in and out as much as you want.

There are two levels of interaction with the game 2 modes

each agent has individual decision making abilities
and there are pantheons

The game is played from the perspective of a leader of a group in a complex world
and his societies pantheon of dieties.

the game cycles between the control of a single avatar during the day time
and the pantheon's view of the group and ways to influence it.

Day view: limited, slow, focused, precise, direct, physical
night view: global, planning, text, lore, pawn management strategy, resource management, builder

day time is kinda like factorio but it's rimworld/the sims. Mostly in control,
but they have needs and will break out of your control if they aren't met.

night time is the gods eye view like in starcraft, rim world, etc. You see everything
your faction can see. You are playing from the perspective of diety so
we can hand wave unit controls etc
the limit is it breaks when the player's avatar wakes up, for any reason.
So you can't do it when your avatar is not safe, and can only be in the mode for the duration of the rest.

of course you can design senarios this doesn't matter.
this is a world builder

# Start a new game

you create a new world first by describing it's pantheon.
There is a default pantheon.
There is one diety you must describe however, that is your factions own.
hand write it's mythos, or cycle through randomly generated options.

This will define the nature of the world you inhabit.
dieties are like forces of nature.
They are interfaces from the world of the gods, to the world of the game.
your factions diety is player's actions manifest with in the game.

You must also at least describe your champion, you may also describe their starting party


# Dieties
# Default Pantheon
All factions have a set of dieties who can influence them.
Part of the fun is that we can collaborate with the AI system to create an interesting mythology together. 

There is no such thing as "balence" Just a good story, a good experience.
You only ruin it for your self if you miss the point.

These are what I think make a good place to start giving them powers and beginning their own mythical journey. Who knows where the AI will take it from this starting base!

I want to provide a minimal set of interesting story moments with the panethon's powers

## Faith vs Favor

Faith is for a specific deity
Favor is a narrative currency

Most things that create faith will also create favor.

Some acts are just generally favorable (A birth, a child growing up, a marriage)
These all give you an instant bonus favor points

You can spend favor to specifically get abilities from a diety
The more faith you have with a diety, the less favor it will require to get abilities from those dieties.

Each diety has some facets associated with it.
As with everything else in this hack to gether guide on something that doesn't exist yet
''
## Mother: Gaia
- food grows faster in your claimed territory (passive)
- can spend faith to improve ground (active)
## Patron :  Hermes
- Agents who are faithful to hermes can be heard from further away and are remembered for longer when communicating (passive)
## Day : Apollo
## Night: Artemis
# Champions

# Thoughts
# Factions

The instances are tilable contiguous happenings that are just not rendered.
Changes in one tile will affect tiles around it.

When you visit a tile for the first time, there is the base map
the world as it is generated by a seed is a contiguous map

That tile is generated, then events are fast forwarded, weather, etc and the result pops out the other side and that is what is getting altered.
The world knows as much as it needs to.
It is as faithful as possible to physical systems with in that world

We want the dynamic story telling of rimworld, dnd, etc, with as much of that world's story being told through physical rules so
story events are causally tied by in game events.

The more arbitrary stuff we do the more it breaks the immersion.

Example:
Rimworld: dice rolls a bunch of times to decide event parameters
raid shows up because something was suposed to show up
and the dice say raid

Fantasia: An agent in a town near made a plan some time ago to attack you, or
an agent in route between two locations chooses to attack because it sees an opertunity.
You have something they want.
