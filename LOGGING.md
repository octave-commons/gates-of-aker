## Logging Control
- Backend uses `fantasia.dev.logging` with environment-based log levels via `LOG_LEVEL` env var.
- Frontend uses controlled console logging via `VITE_LOG_LEVEL` env var, automatically applied during tests.
- Available log levels (both stacks): `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` (default: `warn`).
- Setting log level:
  - Backend: `LOG_LEVEL=debug clojure -X:test` or export before running
  - Frontend: `VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug npm test` or set in `.env` file
- Coverage reporting is configured to show summaries by default, not verbose file-by-file output.
- Frontend test scripts:
  - `npm test` - run tests with default logging (warn+)
  - `npm run test:quiet` - run tests with minimal output
  - `npm run test:debug` - run tests with full debug logging
  - `npm run test:coverage` - run tests with summary coverage report
  - `npm run test:coverage:verbose` - run tests with detailed coverage output
