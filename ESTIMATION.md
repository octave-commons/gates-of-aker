## Estimation & Story Points
- All planning and task estimates use **story points** instead of days/hours.
- Story points represent complexity, risk, and effort as a unified metric.
- 1 story point ≈ 2-3 hours of focused work for a typical task.
- Use story points for sprint planning, issue sizing, and roadmap coordination.
- When estimating, consider: complexity, dependencies, risk, and testing effort.
