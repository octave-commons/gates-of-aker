Hermes flits between gods and mortals as the divine messenger. He carries prayers and delivers blessings across vast distances. His powers enable fast travel, secure commerce, and instant delivery of divine favor to those who please the gods.

**Powers:**

1. **Winged Sandals** - Grants 2x movement speed for 20 ticks, allowing followers to traverse the map rapidly when needed.
2. **Divine Messenger** - Can deliver favor requests to temples with no delay, enabling immediate divine intervention.
3. **Swift Hands** - Instantly transports any item from any stockpile directly to the requesting agent, crucial for emergencies.
4. **Trade Wind** - Boosts trade value of items by 25% for 15 ticks, making merchant caravans more profitable.

**Worship Cost:** Hermes is the most economical god to worship. His powers are practical and have broad utility. He only costs 0.9 favor for his services but grants substantial daily throughput through commerce and logistics.

**Consequences:** Excessive reliance on Hermes can make the colony overly dependent on trade and commerce. Without balanced production, the colony may become wealthy but spiritually hollow.
