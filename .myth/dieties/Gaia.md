Gaia is the primordial earth goddess who births all life into the world. She nurtures growth, protects her children with stone-hardened skin, and blesses them with permanent wisdom and contentment.

**Powers:**

1. **Life Bloom** - Spawns 5 animals (wolves, deer, rabbits) at the temple location to populate the world with life.
2. **Fertile Fields** - Blesses all farms within range 4 tiles with +0.05 extra harvest per tick, dramatically increasing food production.
3. **Stone Skin** - Hardens all buildings within range 6 tiles, reducing damage they take by 10% for 20 ticks. Excellent defensive blessing.
4. **Earth Mother's Blessing** - Grants permanent 0.005 mood increase to all followers, bringing lasting happiness and contentment.

**Worship Cost:** Gaia requires substantial favor (1.1x multiplier) as she is generous but slow-moving. Her powers are about nurturing and protection, requiring patience and long-term commitment.

**Consequences:** Overuse of Stone Skin can make the colony too defensive-minded, stifling innovation and expansion. Life Bloom without balance can lead to overpopulation if not managed properly.
