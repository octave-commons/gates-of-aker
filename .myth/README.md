# Meta-Myths

This directory contains persistent mythology generated by scribes across all world simulations.

## Purpose

Myths generated by scribes persist here and are loaded by new simulations as "ancient echoes from worlds before," creating continuity across playthroughs.

## File

- `myths.jsonl` - All myths in JSON Lines format (one JSON object per line)
  ```json
  {"title": "Tales of Ember", "text": "...", "facets": ["fire"], "created-at": 1234567890}
  ```

## Manual Editing

You can directly edit `myths.jsonl` to:
- Add custom myths
- Modify generated myths
- Remove unwanted myths
- Reorder myths

Each line is a separate JSON object, so you can edit freely.

## Structure

Each myth contains:
- `title` - Book title
- `text` - Mythological story content
- `facets` - Thematic tags (fire, death, harvest, etc.)
- `created_at` - Timestamp when myth was generated

## Integration

The game automatically:
- Loads up to 5 random myths from this file when generating new books
- Appends new myths to this file when scribes complete their work
- Uses myths as context for Ollama generation
