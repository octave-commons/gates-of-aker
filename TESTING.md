## Testing & Single-Test Guidance
- Backend test harness: `clojure -X:test` for full suite or use test runner patterns.
- Backend full run example: `clojure -X:test :patterns '[:all]'`.
- Backend single test example: `clojure -X:test :only 'fantasia.sim.core-test/tick-advances-world'`.
- Backend coverage report: `clojure -X:coverage` generates LCOV report in `backend/target/coverage/lcov.info`.
- Frontend test scripts: `npm test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run test:coverage`.
- Frontend single test example: `npm test -- App.test.tsx`.
- Use deterministic seeds where possible (`sim/reset` accepts `:seed`) to make manual repro scripts reliable.
- Record reproduction steps in `/docs/notes` when bugs require multi-stage setups.
- Do not skip adding tests once the harness exists; include at least one targeted test for every defect fix.
- For temporary manual verification, capture expected WS payloads via browser network tab and link them in PR notes.
- Keep CI scripts (once created) in `.github/workflows`; mirror commands listed here exactly.
