## Meta Myth
- The stories the scribes generates follow us as we keep rebuilding the world.
- Their civilization may have just started, but their gods have seen an infinite dawn
- In game prestiege system
- powers are generated when scribes write texts
	- buffs to your civilization
	- buffs to your champion
	- debuffs to your antagonists
# Brainstorming
- Colonists have a diet component, the name of a list of foods they can like to eat:
	- vegitarian,
	- omnivore,
	- carnivore
- Colonists can upgrade from a tent by crafting a bed indoors (roof, walls, doors, no direct outside)
- The UI should display the total available of each type of resource
- milestone rewards to teach player how to play
- line of sight and revealed areas
	- reduce choices to what an agent would know exists
	- each agent with sight has the area they can see in real time
	- if it has been seen once, it is shown the way it was when it was last seen
- Scribes are creating histories.
	- prompts for generated library books include a legar of people doing actions and what they did those actions on.
	- every object has facet components associated with them
		- facets are describer words with lazy loaded embeddings for dynamic evolution of facets
		- explainations for why things happen are divined from the facet orders, and the way those line up with the traces to divinity
		- dieties have a number of facets, events which can be ascribed to their facets has a chance of being ascribed to them
	- In creating the history they are also trying to explain it, so from the facets they ascribe traces to dieties
	- The number of traces in embedded in the scribes history dedicated to each diety decides how much faith each diety gives the player for the creation of the tome
	- The final text is also ran through the trace system
		- use of the facet words is extracted from the generated text
		- traces are extrapolated from the facets the same way as everything else.
		- Each trace in the tome adds to the faith generated per tick of having the book in the corpus.
- scribes record events and traces between events with facets


## Myth trace
Facets are fixed well underood concepts like "fire" "ice" "night" "day"
They are concepts related to a thing.

Traces are names, they get tied to facetr words through iconography and myth.

The myth which is generated by scribes, whioch literally generates text we use

### Facets 
Every object in the world has a few words describing it
These influence which iconography gets ascribed to a moment when a trace is recorded.
### Moments
A moment is a faceted snapshot of the world as it seems to be at any moment according to a certain entity.
There is the global moment, what actually happened. 
And the moment as limited to a single agents perspective.
Traces are created from this limited perspective of a moment.
### Traces
Traces to mythological iconography established in your cultures pantheon from a current moment. Attempts to explain the world, and gain power. A moment can be traced to an mythical icon if the facets are similar enough. 
### Scroll
When enough traces have been collected by a scribe, you get a scroll. A scroll is an actual document recording an actual in game event with mythical explainations rooted in your pantheon.
Scrolls are mythical objects that survive between games. 
Scrolls are generated by an LLM from a prompted template created from a collection of traces.
New scrolls influence iconography, so it influences the formation of traces.

This is what we need the embeddings for.
If a scribe writes it's thoughts down, the facets save us actually generating an LLM every time the agents talk, they share these facets to.

When they are walking around through out the day they will encounter many items.
Every item has facets associated with it, so the objects they see influence the facets they are thinking about.

Basicly, the more texts in the mythical library, the more possible ways that moments connect to the texts through similarity.

We compare the moments by creating a story filling in blanks with the facets


## Diety
### Iconography
Symbols that relate to the diety 
### Relationships
Relationships in myths between mythical beings is very fuzzy
Every  telling of it is going to be different, 
There is usually a "right now" "correct" though, as the myths evolve.
### Facet associations
What do they govern? fire? wind? war? winter?
### Influence
### Active Powers
### Passive Powers

## How Legends are made
At the very start of the game you are just trying to get a village to survive
make enough food to eat
build enough homes to sleep
collect enough wood for heat
a stove for efficiency, a nicer home, stronger home
a place becomes more than a home, if it holds generations, it is alive.
Before there can be myths, there must be life.
