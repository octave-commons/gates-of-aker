# Brainstorming
- Colonists have a diet component, the name of a list of foods they can like to eat:
	- vegitarian,
	- omnivore,
	- carnivore
- Colonists can upgrade from a tent by crafting a bed indoors (roof, walls, doors, no direct outside)
- The UI should display the total available of each type of resource
- milestone rewards to teach player how to play


# Notes
- "ghost" is a generic type of entity. It's how the user tells the agents to build a building, it's a blue print. There shouldn't be ghost versions of everything. Just one ghost type

## How Legends are made
At the very start of the game you are just trying to get a village to survive
make enough food to eat
build enough homes to sleep
collect enough wood for heat
a stove for efficiency, a nicer home, stronger home
a place becomes more than a home, if it holds generations, it is alive.
Before there can be myths, there must be life.
